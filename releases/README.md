# Release Notes Index

Append-only narrative release notes.

## Authoring

- **One file per release.** Name: `vX.Y.Z.md`. No overwrites.
- **Audience:** human first, then agents picking up context six months later.
- **Structure:** TL;DR → Why → Highlights table → Mermaid diagram → Before/After → Config → Upgrade notes → Files changed.
- **Voice:** pitch, not changelog. If a line could be a commit subject, cut it.
- **Diagrams:** Mermaid only — GitHub renders it natively in release bodies.

## Publishing

The `release.yaml` workflow reads `releases/${{ github.ref_name }}.md` via
`gh release create --notes-file` when a tag is pushed. Missing file → workflow fails loudly.
